# Mugen-Ultimate - Raylib

A fighting game build with the Raylib library, on Visual Studio 2022 with C and C++. I thought for a long time to create a fighting game since i played so much Mugen fan games, and i am going to make one with a different approach: Raylib 5.0
I have already used this great library

## To be able to play this game, you need:
- RayLib 5.0 (in the C:/ disk) ; ( https://www.raylib.com )

## Hardware Requirements
- i dont really know so lets finish the game first : |


### Version v0.1 (17th of October)
  Nothing much, some quality life programs that are came from my ping pong mini game, from the moment i write this
